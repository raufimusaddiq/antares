# Specification Quality Checklist: Blog CMS with AI-Enriched Publishing

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-11-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (resolved: Q1 public readers, Q2 every approved user writes, Q3 suspended author's posts hidden until reinstated)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Ready for `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
- Constitution check for planning: Principle I (public reading is a new unauthenticated surface; drafts stay admin-blind), II (enrichment must go through Hermes, no second pipeline), III (failed checks never shown as done; unsourced data never invented), V (no new services).
